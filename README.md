# How to use?

1. Copy example_folder_structure.yaml
2. rename the copied file to folder_structure.yaml
3. change the folder structure to match what you want to downlaod
4. fill in loom video id
5. fill in name (mp4 & snake case applied automatically)
6. run main.py

## Nice to knows

Folders are automatically indexed with 01_ or in video folder 001_

Folder names can only contain characters that would be allowed in a normal filename (no special chars like $â‚¬\'"/ etc.)

why is this not checked at runtime yet? - because I haven't implemented the check (I am just human :3)
